# Veritas Engine — Whitepaper & Reproducibility

Deterministic, reproducible, metadata-only analysis to distinguish
organic human engagement from coordinated or automated activity.

This repository contains the official whitepaper, examples,
and reproducibility material for the Veritas Engine.

## What is Veritas Engine?
Veritas Engine analyzes **only timestamps and metadata**
(no content, no identities) to classify engagement patterns as:
- ORGANIC
- INDICATIVE_SUSPICIOUS

All outputs are deterministic and hash-verifiable.
